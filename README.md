# DatabasesFinalProject
This repository will be used to store our source code for our CPE365 final project. The project will revolve around the idea of fantasy football.

###To Run the Program:
   1. Run the build-all.mysql with the MySQL dbms of your choice.  

        source build-all.mysql  

   2. Create a file called input and format it as follows. This file will be used to establish a database connection.   

        line 1 <database username>  
        line 2 <database password>  
        line 3 <database address>  
        line 4 <database name>  
        
   
   3. Run the following command:  
       `./run < input`  

###Sample Input File:
    rootismyusername  
    thisismypassword
